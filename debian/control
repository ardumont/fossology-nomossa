Description: architecture for analyzing software, nomos standalone
 The FOSSology project is a web based framework that allows you to
 upload software to be picked apart and then analyzed by software
 agents which produce results that are then browsable via the web
 interface.  Existing agents include license analysis, metadata
 extraction, and MIME type identification.
 .
 This package contains the nomos agent programs and their resources.
